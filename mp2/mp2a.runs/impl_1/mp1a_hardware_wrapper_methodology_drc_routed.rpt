2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-2#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock BRAM_CLK is created on an inappropriate pin PL_CLK_IBUF_BUFG_inst/O. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock BRAM_CLK is defined downstream of clock PL_CLK and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and BRAM_CLK are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks BRAM_CLK]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and BRAM_CLK are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks BRAM_CLK]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on DISPLAY_BUTTON relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on OLED_CONT_RST relative to clock(s) BRAM_CLK 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LED_INIT relative to clock(s) BRAM_CLK 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LED_READY relative to clock(s) BRAM_CLK 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on OLED_DC relative to clock(s) BRAM_CLK 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on OLED_RES relative to clock(s) BRAM_CLK 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#7 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on OLED_SCLK relative to clock(s) BRAM_CLK 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#8 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on OLED_SDIN relative to clock(s) BRAM_CLK 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#9 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on OLED_VBAT relative to clock(s) BRAM_CLK 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#10 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on OLED_VDD relative to clock(s) BRAM_CLK 
Related violations: <none>
